	<p>In life we have different ways of expressing ourselves and in those still some people
			stay calm and an expressive<br>, they are called the introvert, some other choose to shout loud and 
		and get heard; they are called the extrovert, the last part which is very interesting<br> in the mix 
	of the two and they are the called the ambivert. 
But me I don`t know how to call myself because I choose to <br>express myself through technology by making
this world better than it was before.</p>

<center><h1>My passion</h1></center><div class="paragraph3"><img src="a.jpg" alt="">
<p><font size="+3">I`m very passionate about something which can change the fate of the humanity, 
	to cut it short I`m passionate about about making a foot<br> print in the heart of the human being,
	 you may say that there is no need of it as even the humanity <br>have lost faith in itself, what I can reply
	on that is the fact that I vehemently believe in the deep 
	goodness of the human being!.</font></p></div>

<p><font size="+3">The vision I have is to make sure that I`m learning a lot and sufficient, and on that I will be learning with 
the best of the best, when I`m saying so I reffer directly to Andela, me I define Andela as a place where you can 
touch and change the world through technology, and as you will see it later, I have already started
 my journey!.</font></p></div>
 <center><h1>My dreams</h1></center>
 <div class="paragraph1"><img src="download (4).jpg" alt="">
 <p><font size="+3">The is a great and famous qoutes I like which goes like:"People who think that 
	 there are crazy enough to change the world are the ones who do so" by Steve Jobs; 
	 I like to have that feeling of being helpful and important in the community,
	  because I feel like I really have a mission on this earth, that when I know the second important
	day in my life, which is why I was born. And if I cannot do so, 
	at least I got that feeling of making something great, and I know that with the right people by my side it is possible.<br>
